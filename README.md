## Business Question
Which companies face the greatest refinancing risk between 2025–2027 if interest rates remain elevated, and what specific balance-sheet characteristics determine survivability?

---

## Why This Matters
A large volume of corporate debt was issued during the low-rate era of 2020–2021. As that debt matures between 2025–2027, companies must refinance at materially higher rates.

This project evaluates how higher interest costs, liquidity constraints, and leverage profiles interact to create refinancing risk — and which firms are most exposed.

## Analytical Framework
- Debt maturity mapping across 2025–2027  
- Interest expense shock under higher-rate scenarios  
- Coverage, leverage, and liquidity stress testing  
- Scenario-based refinancing feasibility analysis  

---

## Analytical Tooling & Validation
- Google Sheets used for debt schedules, scenarios, and liquidity modeling  
- Python used for rate assumptions, comparisons, and stress-testing logic  

---

## Key Assumptions
- Higher-for-longer interest rate environment  
- No access to ultra-cheap refinancing  
- Liquidity preservation prioritized over growth
