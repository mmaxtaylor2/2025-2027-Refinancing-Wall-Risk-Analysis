## The 2025-2027 Refinancing Wall: Operating Resilience Under Higher-for-Longer Rates



## Problem Statement: 

Between 2025 and 2027, more than $1 trillion of U.S. corporate debt will mature into a structurally higher cost-of-capital environment. Many balance sheets were constructed during a period of near-zero interest rates and have yet to be tested under sustained higher borrowing costs. While markets broadly acknowledge the refinancing wall, they often fail to distinguish between firms that can absorb higher interest expense and those for whom refinancing represents a material solvency or strategic risk. This analysis seeks to identify where refinancing risk translates into genuine financial stress — before it appears in earnings or credit spreads. 



## Objective & Analytical Framework: 

The objective of this project is to evaluate refinancing risk through the lens of operating resilience, rather than headline leverage alone. Using a sector-focused case study approach, the analysis stress-tests near-term debt repricing under higher-for-longer rates and measures the resulting impact on cash flows, leverage, and liquidity. The framework integrates debt maturity profiles, refinancing assumptions, interest stress testing, and liquidity buffers to assess which companies remain financially flexible and which enter a heightened risk zone. 



## Company Selection Rationale: 

The selected REITs represent distinct balance-sheet profiles and operating models within real estate, allowing for meaningful comparison under a uniform rate shock. Boston Properties was chosen for its concentrated office exposure and elevated refinancing needs, representing the most challenged segment of the REIT market. Simon Property Group provides a test of whether high-quality retail assets can offset refinancing pressure through cash flow strength. Equity Residential serves as a defensive residential benchmark with stable demand characteristics, while Prologis represents a best-in-class industrial operator with scale, liquidity, and conservative financing. 



## Key Findings by Company: 

Boston Properties exhibits the weakest operating resilience among the group. Elevated leverage combined with significant debt repricing through 2025-2027 materially increases interest expense under refinancing stress scenarios. While the debt stack is largely fixed-rate, the magnitude and timing of maturities meaningfully compress cash flow flexibility. Liquidity provides some buffer, but not enough to fully offset refinancing-driven pressure. This places the company firmly within the red zone under a sustained higher-rate environment. 

Simon Property Group demonstrates moderate resilience despite a meaningful refinancing exposure. Strong and diversified operating cash flows provide sufficient interest coverage, allowing the company to absorb higher refinancing costs without immediate impairment to financial flexibility. While leverage and maturity concentrations warrant monitoring, stress scenarios remain manageable relative to cash generation, keeping Simon outside the red zone. 

Equity Residential shows strong operating resilience driven by stable residential cash flows, manageable leverage, and comparatively limited refinancing exposure. Stress testing indicates that incremental interest expense consumes only a modest share of funds from operations, preserving dividend capacity and balance-sheet flexibility. Liquidity and predictable earnings provide additional insulation, positioning the company well outside the red zone. 

Prologis stands out as the most resilient operator in the analysis. Conservative leverage, low near-term refinancing exposure, and exceptional interest coverage result in minimal cash flow erosion even under adverse refinancing assumptions. Strong liquidity and scale further enhance financial optionality, leaving Prologis comfortably insulated from refinancing-driven stress. 



## Cross-Company Insights:
The analysis highlights that refinancing risk is not evenly distributed across the REIT sector. Higher-for-longer interest rates function less as a uniform macro shock and more as a balance-sheet quality filter, disproportionately impacting firms with high leverage and near-term repricing exposure. Companies with durable cash flows, conservative financing, and ample liquidity retain strategic flexibility, while structurally challenged balance sheets face compounding pressure as refinancing windows approach. 



## Conclusion: 

The 2025-2027 refinancing cycle will act as a structural stress test for real estate balance sheets rather than a uniform macro headwind. Firms with elevated leverage and concentrated near-term maturities face a meaningful loss of financial flexibility as borrowing costs reset higher, while operators with durable cash flows and disciplined capital structures remain insulated. As refinancing activity accelerates, operating resilience — not sector classification or valuation — is likely to drive performance divergence.
